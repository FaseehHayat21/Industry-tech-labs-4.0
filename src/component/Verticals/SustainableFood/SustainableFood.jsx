        <p>The food value chain is responsible for 25-30% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change is increasingly impacting food security worldwide. Addressing these challenges requires innovation across the entire chain, from production and transportation to minimizing food waste. By improving efficiency in these areas, itâ€™s possible to reduce emissions and contribute to feeding an estimated global population of 9 billion by 2050.</p>
