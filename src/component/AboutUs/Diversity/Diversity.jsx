      <div className="content">
        <p>Since our inception, Infinity Tech Labs has prioritized equitable access to resources
        for entrepreneurs. Our zero-equity, non-profit model ensures that founders with
        limited financial resources or networks can access the support they need to grow
        and succeed.
        </p>
        <p> 
        At Infinity Tech Labs, we believe that a thriving innovation ecosystem is diverse and
        inclusive. Our mission is to embed diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) into the core
        of our entire innovation network. Through these ongoing efforts, we are committed to
        achieving growth and scale in DEI, as we do in every area of our work.

        <p>Our foundational work emphasizes creating an inclusive framework within our
        technical systems, analyzing and refining our operating model and selection
        processes, and partnering with external organizations for insights. These efforts are
        designed to reduce bias and promote equity, ensuring that our processes are fair
        and accessible for all.

        <h1><strong>Internal: Inclusive Culture and Talent</strong></h1>
        <p>Our internal work focuses on fostering an inclusive culture and building a diverse,
        equitable workforce. This includes facilitating open, actionable discussions on anti-
        racism, bias, inclusivity, and equity, as well as hiring, onboarding, and training a
        diverse team. We’re committed to offering growth and development opportunities for
        employees from underrepresented groups and ensuring that our benefits and
        policies align with our inclusivity goals.
